# Sacraments of the Catholic Church
**Sacraments are grace instituted by Jesus Christ for us to be sanctified by God's holiness.** The Catholic Church indicates that the sacraments are necessary for salvation, though not every sacrament is necessary for every individual. In the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church, the sacraments are efficacious signs of grace, instituted by Christ and entrusted to the Church, by which divine life is dispensed to us. The visible rites by which the sacraments are celebrated signify and make present the graces proper to each sacrament. They bear fruit in those who receive them with the required dispositions.

The visible reality we see in the Sacraments is their outward expression, the form they take, and the way in which they are administered and received. The invisible reality we cannot "see" is God's grace, his gracious initiative in redeeming us through the death and Resurrection of his Son. His initiative is called grace because it is the free and loving gift by which he offers people a share in his life, and shows us his favor and will for our salvation. Our response to the grace of God's initiative is itself a grace or gift from God by which we can imitate Christ in our daily lives.

### Sacrament of Baptism
> Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved; whoever does not believe will be condemned. - Mark 16:16 (NABRE)

Baptism is the sacrament through which we are cleansed of original sins. Through Baptism, our sins are forgiven, and we are reconciled with God. We receive a sharing in the life of God and become part of God's people. Baptism declares that you are a follower of Jesus Christ and rightfully Catholic. It is a public confession of your faith in, and commitment to, Jesus Christ. The Sacrament of Baptism also paves way for us to be able to unlock the other sacraments.

### Eucharist
> While they were eating, he took bread, said the blessing, broke it, and gave it to them, and said, “Take it; this is my body.” Then he took a cup, gave thanks, and gave it to them, and they all drank from it. He said to them, “This is my blood of the covenant, which will be shed for many. - Mark 14:22-24 (NABRE)

The Eucharist is the source and summit of the Christian life. The term “Eucharist” originates from the Greek word *eucharistia*, meaning thanksgiving.  In the celebration of the Eucharist, bread and wine become the Body and Blood of Jesus Christ due to transubstantiation through the power of the Holy Spirit and the instrumentality of the priest. The whole Christ is truly present (body, blood, soul, and divinity) under the appearances of bread and wine. Whenever we take Communion, the presence of Christ in the host is real, true and substantial. 

Jesus gives himself to us in the Eucharist as spiritual nourishment because he loves us. By eating the Body and drinking the Blood of Christ in the Eucharist, we become united to the person of Christ through his humanity. In being united to the humanity of Christ, we are at the same time united to his divinity. Our mortal and corruptible natures are transformed by being joined to the source of life. The transformed bread and wine are truly the Body and Blood of Christ and are not merely symbols. When Christ said “This is my body” and “This is my blood,” the bread and wine are transubstantiated. While the bread and wine appear the same to us humans, they are actually the real body and blood of Jesus.

### Sacrament of Confirmation
> And when Paul laid his hands on them, the holy Spirit came upon them, and they spoke in tongues and prophesied. - Acts 19:6 (NABRE)

In this Sacrament, the baptized person is sealed with the gift of the Holy Spirit and is strengthened for service to the Body of Christ. Through Confirmation, our personal relationship with Christ is strengthened. We receive the message of faith in a deeper and more intensive manner with great emphasis given to the person of Jesus Christ, who asked the Father to give the Holy Spirit to the Church for building up the community in loving service. The Sacrament of Confirmation confirms membership in the Christian community and seals Baptism with an anointing. Confirmation consists of a prayer to the Holy Spirit, the laying on of hands while the prayer is said and the anointing of the candidate with oil of Chrism. 

The Church teaches that Confirmation confirms Baptism and is the second formal step in the process of becoming initiated into the Christian community. Confirmation is an invitation to each one of us to renew the Baptismal promises first made on our behalf by our parents and godparents when we were baptised. This process invites us into a deeper way of relating to God, to Jesus and to one another, and to becoming more actively involved in the life of the community through the ongoing presence of the Holy Spirit.

### Sacrament of Confession
> Then I declared my sin to you; my guilt I did not hide. I said, “I confess my transgression to the Lord,” and you took away the guilt of my sin. - Psalms 32:5 (NABRE)

The Sacrament of Confession, also known as Penance or Reconciliation is grace instituted by Jesus Christ in His love and mercy to offer sinners forgiveness for offenses committed against God. In the sacrament, sinners reconcile with the Church who is wounded by our sins, it is an experience of the gift of God's boundless mercy. 

Jesus entrusted the ministry of reconciliation to the Church. The Sacrament is God's gift to us so that any sin committed after Baptism can be forgiven.  In the sacrament, we have the opportunity to repent and recover the grace of friendship with God. It is a holy moment in which we place ourselves in his presence and honestly acknowledge our sins, With absolution, we are reconciled to God and the Church. The Sacrament helps us stay close to the truth that we cannot live without God.

### Anointing of the Sick
> Is anyone among you sick? He should summon the presbyters of the church, and they should pray over him and anoint [him] with oil in the name of the Lord - James 5:14 (NABRE)

Anointing of the Sick is a sacrament which serves as a channel for special graces from God that comfort and heal, physically and/or spiritually, people who are seriously ill and in danger of death. The anointing of the sick can be administered to a Catholic having reached the use of reason, begins to be in danger due to sickness or old age. In this sacrament, through the ministry of the priest, it is Jesus who touches the sick to heal them from sin – and sometimes even from physical ailment. When the Sacrament of Anointing of the Sick is given, the hoped-for effect is that, if it be God's will, the person be physically healed of illness. Although even if there is no physical healing, the primary effect of the Sacrament is a spiritual healing by which the sick person receives the Holy Spirit's gift of peace and courage to deal with the difficulties that accompany serious illness or the frailty of old age. The sacrament is administered by a priest who mainly anoints the patient's forehead while reciting prayers for peace, comfort, healing, and courage.

The special grace of the sacrament of the Anointing of the Sick has its own effects: the uniting of the sick person to the passion of Christ, for his own good and that of the whole Church; the strengthening, peace, and courage to endure in a Christian manner the sufferings of illness or old age; the forgiveness of sins, if the sick person was not able to obtain it through the sacrament of penance; the restoration of health, if it is conducive to the salvation of his soul; the preparation for passing over to eternal life. (CCC 1514)

### Sacrament of Matrimony
> And over all these put on love, that is, the bond of perfection. And let the peace of Christ control your hearts, the peace into which you were also called in one body. And be thankful. - Colossians 3:14-15 (NABRE)

The Sacrament of Matrimony is the covenant in which two baptized people becomes husband and wife. When the Catholic Church teaches that marriage between two baptized persons is a sacrament, it is saying that the couple’s relationship expresses in a unique way the unbreakable bond of love between Christ and His people. In a sacramental marriage, God’s love becomes present to the spouses in their total union and also flows through them to their family and community. By their permanent, faithful and exclusive giving to each other, the couple reveals something of God’s unconditional love. The sacrament of Christian marriage involves their entire life as they journey together through the ups and downs of marriage and become more able to give to and receive from each other. Their life becomes sacramental to the extent that the couple cooperates with God’s action in their life and sees themselves as living “in Christ” and Christ living and acting in their relationship, attitudes and actions.

By their marriage, the couple witnesses Christ's spousal love for the Church. The Sacrament of Marriage is a covenant, which is more than a contract. Covenant always expresses a relationship between persons. The marriage covenant refers to the relationship between the husband and wife, a permanent union of persons capable of knowing and loving each other and God. The celebration of marriage is also a liturgical act, appropriately held in a public liturgy at church. It is also why Catholics are expected to celebrate their marriage under the Church in a liturgical act.

### Sacrament of Holy Orders
> So I exhort the presbyters among you, as a fellow presbyter and witness to the sufferings of Christ and one who has a share in the glory to be revealed. Tend the flock of God in your midst, [overseeing] not by constraint but willingly, as God would have it, not for shameful profit but eagerly. Do not lord it over those assigned to you, but be examples to the flock. And when the chief Shepherd is revealed, you will receive the unfading crown of glory. - 1 Peter 5:1-4 (NABRE)

Pope Francis once said, "Becoming a priest or a man or woman religious is not primarily our own decision, rather it is the response to a call and to a call of love.". The Sacrament of Holy Orders is the sacrament by which bishops, priests and deacons are ordained and receive the power and grace to perform their sacred duties. The sacred rite by which orders are conferred is called ordination. The apostles were ordained by Jesus at the Last Supper so that others could share in His priesthood. Since Christ entrusted his mission to the apostles, He instituted the Holy Orders so His mission can continue to be exercised by the Church until the end of time. It includes three degrees: episcopate (bishop), presbyterate (priest), and diaconate (deacon).

Ordination to the priesthood is always a call and a gift from God. Christ reminded his Apostles that they needed to ask the Lord of the harvest to send laborers into the harvest. Those who seek priesthood respond generously to God's call. This call from God can be recognized and understood from the daily signs that disclose his will to those in charge of discerning the vocation of the candidate.
