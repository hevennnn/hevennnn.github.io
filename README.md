# Sacraments of the Catholic Church
**Sacraments are grace instituted by Jesus Christ for us to be sanctified by God's holiness.** The Catholic Church indicates that the sacraments are necessary for salvation, though not every sacrament is necessary for every individual. In the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church, the sacraments are efficacious signs of grace, instituted by Christ and entrusted to the Church, by which divine life is dispensed to us. The visible rites by which the sacraments are celebrated signify and make present the graces proper to each sacrament. They bear fruit in those who receive them with the required dispositions.

The visible reality we see in the Sacraments is their outward expression, the form they take, and the way in which they are administered and received. The invisible reality we cannot "see" is God's grace, his gracious initiative in redeeming us through the death and Resurrection of his Son. His initiative is called grace because it is the free and loving gift by which he offers people a share in his life, and shows us his favor and will for our salvation. Our response to the grace of God's initiative is itself a grace or gift from God by which we can imitate Christ in our daily lives.

### Sacrament of Baptism
> Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved; whoever does not believe will be condemned. - Mark 16:16 (NABRE)

Baptism is the sacrament through which we are cleansed of original sins. Through Baptism, our sins are forgiven, and we are reconciled with God. We receive a sharing in the life of God and become part of God's people. Baptism declares that you are a follower of Jesus Christ and rightfully Catholic. It is a public confession of your faith in, and commitment to, Jesus Christ. The Sacrament of Baptism also paves way for us to be able to unlock the other sacraments.

### Eucharist
> While they were eating, he took bread, said the blessing, broke it, and gave it to them, and said, “Take it; this is my body.” Then he took a cup, gave thanks, and gave it to them, and they all drank from it. He said to them, “This is my blood of the covenant, which will be shed for many. - Mark 14:22-24 (NABRE)

The Eucharist is the source and summit of the Christian life. The term “Eucharist” originates from the Greek word *eucharistia*, meaning thanksgiving.  In the celebration of the Eucharist, bread and wine become the Body and Blood of Jesus Christ due to transubstantiation through the power of the Holy Spirit and the instrumentality of the priest. The whole Christ is truly present (body, blood, soul, and divinity) under the appearances of bread and wine. Whenever we take Communion, the presence of Christ in the host is real, true and substantial. 

Jesus gives himself to us in the Eucharist as spiritual nourishment because he loves us. By eating the Body and drinking the Blood of Christ in the Eucharist, we become united to the person of Christ through his humanity. In being united to the humanity of Christ, we are at the same time united to his divinity. Our mortal and corruptible natures are transformed by being joined to the source of life. The transformed bread and wine are truly the Body and Blood of Christ and are not merely symbols. When Christ said “This is my body” and “This is my blood,” the bread and wine are transubstantiated. While the bread and wine appear the same to us humans, they are actually the real body and blood of Jesus.

### Sacrament of Confirmation
> And when Paul laid his hands on them, the holy Spirit came upon them, and they spoke in tongues and prophesied. - Acts 19:6 (NABRE)

In this Sacrament, the baptized person is sealed with the gift of the Holy Spirit and is strengthened for service to the Body of Christ. Through Confirmation, our personal relationship with Christ is strengthened. We receive the message of faith in a deeper and more intensive manner with great emphasis given to the person of Jesus Christ, who asked the Father to give the Holy Spirit to the Church for building up the community in loving service. The Sacrament of Confirmation confirms membership in the Christian community and seals Baptism with an anointing. Confirmation consists of a prayer to the Holy Spirit, the laying on of hands while the prayer is said and the anointing of the candidate with oil of Chrism. 

The Church teaches that Confirmation confirms Baptism and is the second formal step in the process of becoming initiated into the Christian community. Confirmation is an invitation to each one of us to renew the Baptismal promises first made on our behalf by our parents and godparents when we were baptised. This process invites us into a deeper way of relating to God, to Jesus and to one another, and to becoming more actively involved in the life of the community through the ongoing presence of the Holy Spirit.

### Sacrament of Confession
> Then I declared my sin to you; my guilt I did not hide. I said, “I confess my transgression to the Lord,” and you took away the guilt of my sin. - Psalms 32:5 (NABRE)
